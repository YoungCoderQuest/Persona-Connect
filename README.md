# MBTI Personality Classification and Networking Application

## Synopsis

The MBTI Personality Classification and Networking Application is a project that utilizes the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to categorize individuals into 16 distinct personality types based on four psychological phenomena: Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I), Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N), Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F), and Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P). Additionally, the application provides a safe space for discussions on personality types for those interested in the subject.

The networking aspect of the application involves concepts such as UDP connection, packet filtering firewall, multiple client-server chat, and group chat. The primary function is to examine the header information of network packets and determine whether to allow or block them based on a set of predefined rules.

## Networking Concepts

- **UDP Connection:** Utilizes UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for network communication.
- **Multiple Client-Server Chat:** Supports communication between multiple clients and a server.
- **Group Chat:** Facilitates group communication within the application.
- **Packet Filtering Firewall:** Examines packet header information and applies predefined rules to allow or block packets.

## Networking Tools

- **Packet Capture Libraries:** Used to capture and analyze network packets.
- **Error Handling:** Implements error handling mechanisms for robust application behavior.
- **Multi-Threading:** Utilizes multi-threading for concurrent execution and efficient networking.
- **Access Control Lists:** Manages access control through predefined lists.
- **Java Socket Programming:** Implements networking functionality using Java sockets.
- **Java Firewall Frameworks:** Utilizes Java frameworks for implementing packet filtering firewall.
